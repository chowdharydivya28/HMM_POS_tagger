# HMM_POS_tagger
This implement Hidden Markov Models (HMM) from scratch and applies HMM to Part-of-Speech Tagging problem. Part-of-Speech (POS) is a category of words (or, more generally, of lexical items) which have similar grammatical properties. (Example: noun, verb, adjective, adverb, pronoun, preposition, conjunction, interjection, and sometimes numeral, article, or determiner.)

Part-of-Speech Tagging (POST) is the process of marking up a word in a text (corpus) as corresponding to a particular part of speech, based on both its definition and its context. This project uses use HMM to do POST. You will need to calculate the parameters (pi, A, B, obs_dict, state_dict) of HMM first and then apply Viterbi algorithm to do speech-tagging
